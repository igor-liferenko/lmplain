THIS FILE BELONGS TO METATYPE1 PACKAGE; IT IS AN INFORMAL COLLECTION OF NOTES

HISTORY
0.2  (16.12.2000, Grudzi/adz meeting)
first numbered version of fontbase.mp

0.21 (16.12.2000)
fontbase.mp: some corrections due to JMN's suggestions

0.22 (07.01.2001)
fontbase.mp (JMN's suggestion): writing dim_file; ghost stems generalized;
italic correction corrected; proof colors changed; default uc_height, depth,
ascender, and descender uniformized

0.23 (12.01.2001)
fontbase.mp: default blue_fuzz is now 0; set_stem added; dimen report
is generated on demand, governed by tracingdimens internal variable

0.24 (11.03.2001)
fontbase.mp: compose_segment and delete_nodes macros added

0.25 (08.05.2001)
fontbase.mp: positioning of accent hints corrected

0.26 (11.05.2001)
fontbase.mp: besides space, nbspace char is also added
if missing but at the same time encoded, and if slot 160 is free

0.27 (04.08.2001, Grudzi/adz meeting)
fontbase.mp: in use_accent the statement `off_acc_:=round(off_acc_)'
corrected; pf_info_designsize fixed (used to use macro set_tf),
pf_info_quad, and pf_info_pfm added; pfcommon.dat and afm2pfm
updated accordingly; VM comment removed from pfcommon.dat (temporarily?);
macro \MF corrected in mpform.sty; a few touches in mpform.mft;
no more designsize-vs.-design_size mess

0.28 (12.08.2001)
fontbase.mp: superfluous assign_name._space("space") and
assign_name._nbspace("nbspace") (following introduce) removed
from complete_pf_info

0.29 (12--20.08.2001)
fontbase.mp: math_axis is drawn by show_bb; plain_ex.mp -- pen_stroke
added (to improve: re-building of pen-stroked edges, removing inner
loops of pen-stroked edges, cutting off some parts of a path);
`turn_angle' should be used in a more robust way.

0.30 (21.08.2001)
plain_ex.mp -- gets the same numbering as fontbase; internal variable
of pen_stroke, ang_rel_, is boolean now; macros cut_join and nib_join
(abbreviated later to cut and nib) may have a nib parameter
optional; skipped nib means obviously default_nib.

0.31 (11.09.2001--22.09.2001)
mpform.sty: first attempt to prepare a one-or-two-language version
mkproof.bat: form of `copy ...+...' changed, `call mpost' --> `mpost', 
  variable generating used instead of external_project (see below);
plain_ex.mp:
  * soften_path, soften_nodes, quicksort, and insert_nodes added;
    delete_nodes moved from fontbase.mp to plain_ex.mp
  * generisize macro borrowed from J. D. Hobby's boxes.mp
fontbase.mp: more profound changes:
  * internal variables show_fills, show_strokes, show_paths, show_labels,
    show_boxes, show_stems, and show_stencils introduced;
  * variable generating now controls generating fonts: if known and
    equal to 0 -- PS fonts are generated, if known and equal to 1 --
    TFM files are generated, otherwise -- proofs are generated
  * separating use_... form ship_... for glyphs and hints;
    use_... renamed to do_show..., namely: do_show_hints, do_show_stencils,
    do_show_glyphs, do_show_labels, do_show_boxes,
  * bbox of the output EPSes is forced (force_bbox) in proofing mode
  * characters names can conform Pascal language conventions, in particular,
    they may contain digits
  * add_selected (an obsolete version of introduce_selected) removed
  * a bug in pf_info_creationdate fixed
  * piclist file is now not generated only when TFM files are being
    generated; it is used both for proofing and assembling the font
  * write_tex writes the macro call (\EPSNAMEandNUMBER) rather than
    raw TeX code
  * the && operator ignores a preceding parameter if it is a pair
  * a bug (typo) fixed in the definition of introduce_nodes
  * a bug fixed in the definition of local_tip_ (for the left edge)
mp2pf.awk: a call to system (directory listing) replaced by the reading
  of piclist.tex (presuming the presence of \EPSNAMEandNUMBER);
  messages and comments changed to English language 
mpform.sty: the definition of \EPSNAMEandNUMBER added

0.3? 11.01.2002
plain_ex.mp:
  * soften_path: 
    p_:=soften_node(i_,p_,r); --> p_:=soften_node(p_,r,i_);
  * whatever_pair restored (lost some day after March 2001, why?)
  * few changes in Polish texts

20.02.2002--23.02.2002
mpform.sty:
  * \tentex defined explicitly
  * \setcnt and \endproof added
mkproof.bat:
  * adjusted respectively

01.03.2002:
  * afm2pfm.pl (v. 0.12): font kind was wrongly guessed
    due to an error in a regular expression 

13.03.2002:
  * fontbase.mp: variable absolute_stencils introduced
    (session with Wlodek Bzyl)

19.03.2002:
  * mp2pf: odd `if (x == 0.0) return "0/1"' --> `if (x == 0.0) return "0 1"'

21.03.2002:
  * pfcommon.dat:
    Generated by Metpost --> Generated by MetaType1 (a MetaPost-based engine)
  * fontbase.mp:
    introduce_selected: process_selected=1 --> process_selected:=1
    (multiple use of introduce_selected is now legal); a comment corrected

30.03.2002:
  * plain_ex.mp: fixed bug (the explicit using of possibly indexed suffix
    in declaration of `path' variable in find_outlines); moreover,
    <suffix>.num is also declared explicitly to be of type numeric --
    see phrase:
     if not path r[0]: scantokens("path " & generisize(str r) & "[]"); fi
     if not numeric r.num: scantokens("numeric " & generisize(str r.num); fi

05.06.2002:
  * fontbase.mp:
      -- silly bug fixed in assign_name:
           if not string glyph_stencil @#:
         changed to
           if not string glyph_ps_name @#:
      -- warningcheck:=-1 added (because of names afii10065, afii10066 etc.)
      -- changed definition of write_tex header:
         (suffix name)(expr num) --> (expr name, num)
  * mpform.mft: assign_name formatted
    REMARK: variables of form x0 1 2 3 are formatted as x0123
            in the context of `good', and thus also in context of
            wd, ht, dp; in other words, wd.x0 1 2 3 is (in proof)
            indistingushable from wd.x0123; is it OK?
  * mpform.sty: subscript mark (underscore character) is gobbled
    after a PS name

13--15.07.2002 (Grudzi/adz -- several troubles overcome):
  * fontbase.mp:
    -- macro set_stem enhanced (see the relevant comment);
       it didn't rounded its parameters, as well as mf2pf.awk,
       and thus produced something like 
         /StemSnapH[... 63.998 64 ...]def
       which caused the hanging of Acrobat Distiller
    -- use_glyph introduced (JMN's desire)
  * mpform.sty: further consecuences of ``underscore freaks'':
    special protection of the underscore appearing in names
    due to f_k
  * mpform.mft: glyph_shift and set_stem, set_hstem, set_vstem formatted
  COMMENT: if during destillation fonts vere not loaded partially, e.g.,
    only below 35% (of WHAT?!), Acrobat Reader 3.0 didn't show
    all the characters for a ``large'' version of ANTT;
    the change of the threshold 35% --> 99% helped

18.07.2002:
fontbase.mp:
  * reference to the node operator in macro set_stem
    replaced by a `point ... of ...' construction
  * plain_ex: macros node, first, last, nflipped,
    nrotated (so far in Antykwa P/o/ltawskiego's ``lego'' file)
    and, moreover, xflipped, yflipped, crotated added;
    macros nflipped and nrotated correspond to pmirr and prefl,
    respectively; however, both nflipped and nrotated just do nothing
    for a cyclic path, while pmirr and prefl -- for unknown reason --
    reverse an argument path; for non-cyclic paths they can be defined as:
      def pmirr = nflipped enddef;
      def prefl = nrotated 180 enddef;
  * mpform.mft:
    added: *flipped, *nrotated

24.07.2002:
  * fontbase.mp: label font changed: cmr17 --> cmr10,
    defaultscale 1.5 --> magstep5 (actually, introduced five months ago,
    24.02.2002, around Hel meeting, but then somehow overlooked...)

25.07.2002:
  * plain_ex.mp:
    added: killtext, is_suffix
  * fontbase.mp:
    -- uni_name re-implemented using is_suffix
    -- spec_comma replaced by a more general macro fix_name_list
    -- introduce_selected reimplemented using fix_name_list
    -- mix_stem renamed to use_stems
    -- use_accent, use_stems, use_glyph (def -> vardef),
       use_stored (def -> vardef) admit both suffix and string
       form of names
    -- use_stems has optional offset
    -- use_accent admits color as an optional offset; for a color c,
       (redpart c, greenpart c) denote the shift of the character
       being accented
    -- use_stored removed as functionally nearly equivalent
       to newly introduced use_glyph (the latter enables
       repositioning)
  * mpform.mft:
    added: killtext, is_suffix, fix_name_list,
           use_accent, use_glyph, use_stems

26.07.2002:
  * fontbase.mp: typo fixed in use_stems (offset instead of offset_)
  
30.07.2002:
  * pf2mt1.awk (v. 0.13): a special option, NO_SLANT, added
  * fontbase.mp: ht_accent_limit introduced (supposedly bottom accent
    if ht.accent < ht_accent_limit)

31.07.2002:
  * afm2pfm (v. 0.13): typo in a comment fixed; banner added, message changed
  * packsubr (v. 0.1): VERBOSE added, banner added
  * mp2pf: banner added
  * mktfm.bat born (out of a part of mkfont.bat)

04.08.2002:
  * plain_ex.mp, plain_e_.mp: macro delete_nodes more elaborately
    described (illustration added); the text parameter is now
    delimited (upward incompatibility -- rather harmless?)

ver 0.32 of METAPOST1 (intra-JNS release) 08.08.2002--19.08.2002:
  * mt1set.bat:  added (as a common for all batches that
                 need setting environment variable METATYPE1)
    mkfont.bat:  preserves MP log file (from the 1st MP pass), comments touched
    mkt1.bat:    added (dual to mktfm). 
    mktfm.bat:   preserves MP log file, comments touched
    mkproof.bat: comment touched
    All batches updated to be compatible with the most recent
    distributions of t1utils (1.26, also with 1.24 from TeXLive 7)
    and MFT (Web2C 7.37x, 2.0)
  * pfcommon.dat also adjusted to new t1utils (cleartomark added)
    (ver 0.11)
  * pf2mt1: moved from extras to the main distribution, after a few
    enhancements and bug fixes; *.exc file also has changed
  * mpform.sty and mpform.mft renamed to mt1form.sty and mt1form.mft,
    respectively (new MFT deals with MP sources, hence mpform is too
    general name).
  * nearly all files touched (belonging to METATYPE1 explicitly expressed)
    except those in SAMPLES directory; in EXTRA directory only README has
    changed

ver 0.33 of METAPOST1 07.09.2002-09.09.2002
  * batch mt1set: a comment touched
  * fontbase.mp: short-cuts  family_name, font_name, and full_name added

26.10.2002:
  * afm2pfm, ver. 0.14, -- sub prepare_data() --> sub prepare_data;

30.12.2002:
  * plain_ex, ver. 0.32: `crotated' corrected; (used to work only with
    non-cyclic paths; backward incompatible change, hopefully innocuous)

03.01.2003:
  * plain_ex, ver. 0.33: xscaledto and yscaledto added; *scaleto
    operators store most recent scaling factor in a `lastscale';
    similarly, *shiftedto operators leave most recent shift vector
    in a `lastshift' variable (backward compatible change);
    aliases added: `xtime' and `ytime' for `x_time' and `y_time',
    respectively; `emergency_turningnumber' introduced; comments touched
    ``sharp units'' (mm#, pt#, dd#, bp#, cm#, pc#, cc#, in#)
    moved from fontbase to plain_ex.
  * fontbase, ver. 0.34: a lot of changes due to handling fontdimens
    and headerbytes (in particular, AFM XHeight need not to be equal to
    TFM xheight, i.e., fontdimen 5); no special comment for space params
    and quad; tfm_units and ps_units more accurate (old versions preserved);
    WARNING: the latter change is backward incompatible, but for
    Knuth's logo font TFM files remain intact (due to the trick
    with ``hashed'' variables in tfm_units)
  * pfcommon.dat, ver 0.12: adjusted to the changes in fontbase;
  * afm2pfm, ver. 0.15: adjusted to the changes in pfcommon.dat;
  * mp2pf, ver. 0.32: adjusted to the changes in fontbase and pfcommon.dat

06.01.2003:
  * mp2pf, ver. 0.33: function rational: unlikely case included (as a comment)

11.01.2003:
  * pf2mt1, ver. 0.16: adjusted to the changes in fontbase and pfcommon.dat
  
16.01.2003:
  * afm2pfm, ver. 0.16: old convention of PFM parameters restored
    (along with the new one)
  * pfcommon.dat, ver 0.13: ASCENDER and DESCENDER
    distinguished from ADL_ASCENDER and ADL_DESCENDER

17.01.2003:
  * fontbase ver. 0.35: continuation of changes due to a new way of
    fontdimen handling; compliance with the above change in pfcommon.dat;
    the option od rigorous encoding introduced (if variable
    `rigorous_encoding' is known, only characters existing
    in TFM will appear in the encoding file); `uncode' operations
    introduced (for overriding current encoding); several
    vardefs replaced by defs
  * afm2pfm, ver. 0.16: careful rounding

18.01.2003:
  * plain_ex ver. 0.34: gen_whatever added; soften_path performs
    a loop only for radius > 0;
  * mp2pf ver. 0.34: adjustment to ``Ascender/Descender story'';
    a few minor changes

04.02.2003:
  * mkfont.bat, mkt1.bat, mktfm -- (optional) files *.dim are handled like
    *.afm, *.pfb, *.log and *.pfm files, i.e., they are copied to a resulting
    directory (for mkfont, *.dim left by non-TFM run is preserved, but
    both log files);

06.02.2003:
  * fontbase ver. 0.36: nbspace is not added in TFM run;
    is_stored and use_dimens added

15.02.2003:
  * pf2mt1 ver 0.17: a lot of changes (most important: FontMatrix and
    seac handled)
  * fontbase ver. 0.37: a ``namespace'' bug fixed: local offset_ variable
    must not be declared in use_stems _and_ somewhere else (used to be
    declared in use_glyph).

19.02.2003:
  * mt1form.sty: info moved from footline to headline 
  * pf2mt1 ver 0.18: newly introduced correct_path_directions handled

20.02.2003:
  * fontbase ver. 0.38: correct_path_directions added along with
    a binary inside operator; exclude_selected introduced
  * mf1form.mft a few new items

04.03.2003:
  * pf2mt1 batch touched (`if exist' clause added)

26.03.2003:
  * fontbase ver. 0.39:
    font_math_axis math_rule; --> font_math_axis math_axis; !!!
  * pf2mt1.awk ver. 019 flex resolving procedure used to return
    curveto instead of rrcurveto; now the occurence of flex is
    marked (as a comment) in *.mpg; comment in pf2mt1.exc touched

31.03.2003:
  * fontbase ver. 0.40: a nasty yet silly bug in correct_path_directions
    fixed (by PSt): condition `odd i_' instead of `odd idx_[i_]'...
  * comments in enc*.mp files touched
  * pf2mt1.awk ver. 0.20:
    another silly bug fixed, namely:
    wrong template "pf_info_fontdimen %2d: %s"
    replaced by "pf_info_fontdimen %2d, %s"
    comments touched; the version _with the bug_ sent as. 0.20 to
    WB, MW, and JMN, a bit prematurely (bad days...)
  * plain_ex.awk ver. 0.35: p_ saved in pen_stroke

29.04.2003:
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.41: a substantial change of the implementation
    of a few pf_info... commands: pf_info_space, pf_info_xheight,
    pf_info_quad, pf_info_extra_space; added: pf_info_normal_space,
    pf_info_space_stretch and pf_info_space_shrink;
    a condition (designsize<>0) checked prior to using tfm_units;
    accordingly, complete_tfm_info changed; moreover,
    font_math_rule and font_math_axis corrected (they wrote PS units
    to AFM comments; it was a bad day when they were implemented
    for the first time -- see 26.03.2003).
  * mt1form.mft augmented
  * mp2pf.awk ver 0.35: a bug in gawk circumvented; the following three-liner
      BEGIN {a(); b(S)}
      function a() {delete S}
      function b(s) {s[0]}
    reports an error: ... fatal: delete: illegal use of variable `S' as array
    (in this case, the error can be circumvented by adding a dummy
    function definition at the beginning of the script:
      function c() {S[0]}
    )

02.05.2003: option /b consequently added in copy statements in batches
    mkproof and mkfont (Win XP adds EOF character otherwise)

21.05.2003:
  pf2mt1.bat: used to accept only 1 parameter
  mt1set.bat: performs a trickery in order to convert backslashes
              into slashes in %METATYPE1%; will it work with every shell?
  set METATYPE1=%BOP_UTI%/metatyp1
  gawk "BEGIN {s=ENVIRON[\"METATYPE1\"]; gsub(/\\/,\"/\",s); print \"set METATYPE1=\" s}" > mt1set_.bat
  call mt1set_.bat
  del mt1set_.bat

05.06.2003: preparing a new distribution (for 11.06.2003);
  mkfont.bat and mkproof.bat renamed to mkfont1.bat and mkproof1.bat
  (Wlodek Bzyl's suggestion)

11.06.2003:
  * pf2mt1.awk: a bug in adl data fixed; now ADL_DESCENDER
    is positive (default 250)
  * version 0.40 of METATYPE1 released.

14.07.2003:
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.42: a circumvention of dvips fragile dvips prologues
    and inaccuracy of epsf macros (operation force_bbox)
  * TeX'n'ANSI encoding added, i.e., LY1 (enctxnan.mp)

15.07.2003:
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.43: pf_info_space corrected; a next silly
    bug in correct_path_directions ('t was a bad day...) fixed,
    more precisely, in the inside operator:
    @x
     (xpart urcorner b > xpart llcorner a) and
    @y
     (xpart urcorner b > xpart urcorner a) and
    @z
    added: extra_beginfont, extra_endfont
  * Text Companion encoding added, i.e., TS1 (enctctex.mp); all encodings
    are now equipped in a distinguishing encoding_badge macro

03.08.2003:
  ENCQXWIN.MP -- characters of codes < 32 unencoded (version 1.05a)
  ENCTCTEX.MP -- perthousandzero removed (it is now in ENCECTEX.MP)
  ENCECTEX.MP -- perthousand replaced by perthousandzero

23.08.2003--24.08.2003:
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.44 UPWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!
    (``And his name is Fourty and Four'' -- A. Mickiewicz)
    encode, LK, LP, and KP commands refer to METATYPE1 (internal)
    names; so far, they used to refer to PostScript names;
    -- the parameters of encode, LP and KP are now of text type,
       therefore they MUST NOT be separated by commas; instead, they
       must be taken in separate braces, e.g.,
         encode("a_char")(128)
         LK("a_char")
          LP("another_char")("yet_another_char")
          KP("and_yet_another_char")(30)
         KL
    -- a bundle of related renamings:
       ps_name_used() --> name_used()

       ps_name_xused[] --> name_used_[]
       glyph_ps_code() --> name_to_code()

       ps_used_max --> max_name_used
    -- comments touched
  * pf2mt1.mp ver. 0.22
    -- adjustments to the changes listed above
    -- corrected checking of ligtable data
  * encodings corrected adequately; QX 1.06 implemented
  * samples updated
 
11.02.2004:
  fontbase changed (glyph_name_ext added) without changing the version number

20.02.2004:
  pfcommondat: 
  Generated by MetaType1 ... -> Comment Generated by MetaType1 ... 

17.06.2004:
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.45 a nasty bug fix: glyph_shift for a given
    character is now set also in use_accent and use_glyph

14.07.2004:
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.46: fix_stem optionally may ignore direction
    at nodes (if variable loose_fix_stem is set to a known value);
    it seems that hinting is to be reprogrammed nearly from scratch,
    it may turn out that the backward compatibility cannot be maintained...

18.09.2004--28.02.2005: released as MT1 ver. 0.45
  * (08.10.2004, sent to JMN: fontbase.mp ver. 0.47,
    pf2mt1.awk ver. 0.23, afm2pfm.awk ver. 0.18)
  * fontbase.mp ver. 0.47/0.485: beginning of larger enhancement
    -- fontdimen names are controlled by METAPOST only
       (hence the version 0.36 of MP2PF script)
    -- math fontdimen handled
    -- in the complete_tfm routine fontdimens are set optionally
       (only if they haven't been set).
    -- usage of loose_fix_stem fixed
    -- wd.glyh_name is set in fix_tfm_data (if unknown)
    -- glyph_axis info is written to the dim file if tracingdimen>1
       (besides wd, ht, dp and ic)
    -- feasible_node reprogrammed in order to avoid clearxy command
    -- glyph_axis is being set in use_accent only if it is unknown
  * pf2mt1.awk ver. 0.23:
    -- SNAP_TO_NODE is consequently squared
    -- PFM parmeters used to be dropped (due to a wrong pattern:
       "parameters" instead "parameters:")
    -- MPH is being input befor beginfont
    -- the node coordinates are formatted (in order to avoid
       casual exponential notation)
  * afm2pfm.awk ver. 0.18:
    -- a few minor changes; most important one: no limits on the number
       of kerns (parameter nokernlimit or --nokernlimit);
  * mp2pf.awk ver. 0.37:
    -- doubled kerns and ligatures ignored
    -- messages touched

14.03.2005: released as MT1 ver. 0.46
  * plain_ex ver. 0.365 -- the result of the `maybeinput' operation is stored
    in a boolean variable (`maybeinput_ok').
  * encoding files (encec.mp, encly1.mp, encqxtex.mp, encqxwin.mp, enct5.mp,
    encts1.mp) set: encoding_already_fixed:=1;

03.04.2005:
  * plain_ex 0.37 -- macros predir and postdir generalised (gendir,
    a counterpart for direction, added); macros area and Area introduced;
    mt1form.mft updated.

14--15.05.2005 (sent to JMN):
  * pf2mt1
      0.24: formatting in flush_node changed to avoid exponential notation
            (of 23.12.2004, but the version number was left intact)
      0.25: a bug in the interpretation of parameters of
           the `Space' AFM comment (``AMS convention'') fixed
  * plain_ex, 0.38 -- a new (optional) method of finding a pen stroke
       implemented, the old one made more robust; the macros
       `dotnorm' and `force_convex_edge' added; documentation
       supplemented

26--29.06.2005
  * plain_ex, 0.39
    -- again upward incompatible change!!! (last one?)
       binary operators:
         mirr xscaledto xyscaledto xyscaledto yscaledto
         yxscaledto llshiftedto lrshiftedto
         urshiftedto ulshiftedto ccshiftedto ^ leg
       used to be tertiaryded; now they are primarydefed, which is consistent
       with properties of such operators like scaled, mod, **, etc.
       There is a little chance that these operators without full grouping,
       so better please check your sources -- they may need adjustment!
       here you have a simple AWK script that spots the relevant places
       in a METATYPE1 code:

       ### END AWK SCRIPT
    -- further sophistication of the pen_stroke
    -- elongation_to_times added
    -- all nodes specified in cut, tip and nib can have modifiers l and r
       (no modifier means both), rel applied to an angle
       can be used with all pen_stroke opts (so far it was available only
       with cut)
    -- current_node is available in pen_stroke opts
    -- newinternal default_elongation, default_join, default_cap added

09--11.07.2005 (sent to JMN on 11.07.2005)
  * fontbase.mp (v. 0.49), mp2pf.awk (v. 0.38), afm2pfm (v. 0.19),
    pf2mt1 (v. 0.26), and pfcommon.dat (v. 0.15) touched in order to handle
    implicit encodings (such as StandardEncoding; see encase.mp); some
    minor improvements (e.g., PFM CharSet can be given in an AFM comment)
    and fixes (e.g., the setting of DefaultChar in afm2pfm was not
    sufficiently robust). All encodings touched, encase.mp added.

    added, pen_stroke_method 2 implemented (the same as 1 but no forcing
    of convex edges takes place); comments touched.
  * plain_ex.mp (ver. 0.41) enhanced: pretension and posttension operators
  * fontbase.mp (ver. 0.51): a bug (related to overlapping stems and
    ghost stems; remainders of the introducing of the new hinting
    scheme...) fixed; checking for the presence of dishes, i.e., for

    encel.mp added; the number (and date) of version left intact

16.01.2007
  * release 0.48x (in connection with the TeX Gyre pproject) --
    more encoding files added; at the moment the distribution contains:
    encase.mp enccs.mp enccssc.mp encec.mp encecsc.mp encel.mp encelsc.mp
    encl7x.mp encl7xsc.mp encly1.mp encly1sc.mp encqxtex.mp encqxtsc.mp
    encqxwin.mp encrm.mp encrmsc.mp enct2a.mp enct2b.mp enct2c.mp
    enct5.mp enct5sc.mp encts1.mp

27.02.2007

    to be used in an exception file

17.09.2007
  * afm2pfm, ver 0.20 -- values not given explicitly in AFMs set to
    default values (with a message)

21.01.2008

    new encodings were introduced, namely, enccscsc.mp, enccsctt.mp,
    encqxcsc.mp, encqxctt.mp, encrmcsc.mp, and encrmctt.mp (CM-oriented
    "small caps" and "typewriter" counterparts of the cs, qx and rm
    encodings, respectively)

05.06.2008:
  * plain_ex (no ver. change) -- several typos corrected

10.06.2009
  * plain_ex 0.43 -- in several places `direction' changed to `gendir',
    `predir' or `postdir', whichever most adequate; problem emerged
    because of the ending of stroked paths with the `cut' operator
    for ``straight segments'' -- i.e., 

12.06.2009
  * plain_ex 0.43 (ver. unchganged) pen_join corrected (instead
    of interpolation, control nodes are used explicitly) and the
    comment concerning `fix_nib' changed (incommutability
    of interpolation and transformations) -- both corrections are,
    of course, related

10.07.2009
  * fontbase 0.53 -- mainly labeling and glyph visualisation touched
    to make them more flexible (in particular, `show_compose' added);
    the macro `compose_path' generalized (undefined nodes are ignored).
  
  * pf2mt1 0.30 -- right and left ghoststems handled; still, ghoststems need
    more careful handling (their negative value must not be ignored)

  * plain_ex 0.44 -- `insert_nodes' more robust (see the comment "to |mod|
    or not to |mod|?"), `insert_extremes' added

19.07.2009
  * plain_ex 0.45 -- `correct_close_doublets' based on `delete_ nodes'

20.08.2009
  * plain_ex 0.46 -- a nasty bug removed (in `pen_stroke_edge': last node
    of a cyclic path was handled improperly); improved the procedure of
    drawing pen envelope (careful deleting of nodes in places
    where a fragment of a pen is drawn)

15.09.2009
  * fontbase 0.55 -- glyph shift taken into account in the positioning of accentee (macro `use_accent')

16.09.2009 -- RELEASE 0.55

06.12.2009

15.01.2012
  *  pf2mt1.awk 0.31 -- sanitize_name adds _ if the name ends with a digit, treat dots as digits
     (the corrections soon abandoned -- see below)

19.02.2012
  *  pf2mt1.awk 0.32 -- corrections 0.31 abandoned, NO_STEMS and ROUND_COORD parameters
     added; NO_SLANT explicitly mentioned in the preamble

27.02.2013
  * plain_ex 0.46 -- double precision excludes notation `<number>epsilon' (must be `<number>*epsilon')
    version number unchanged

19.04.2013

    version number unchanged

27.04.2015
